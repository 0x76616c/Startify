Windows 11 Start Menu replacement based on Xamlislands. 
Currently, it features Windows 10 Layout combined with Windows 11 Theme and Style. 
Made by Lixkote mainly for personal use and later for use in Rectify11.

**Note: This application is in its alpha stage, many features might be bugged or not working at all. 
The app's author is not responsible for the damage using the alpha version might cause**

**Tutorials and documentation for various config files as well as first "installable" releases coming soon.**

**You should be able to just compile it with the latest Visual Studio (vs2022 or vs2022 preview) .
If the application does not run after installation, and displays a missing .net core runtime error please download the following runtime and install it.**
[.NET Core 3.1 Runtime for Windows 11 64 bit](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.32-windows-x64-installer)
