**Work in progress recreation of the Windows 10's start menu for all Windows 11 builds.**

## How to launch - notes

1. Remember that Startify Requires the following runtime to start:
[.NET Core 3.1 Runtime x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.32-windows-x64-installer)

2. ![fix](https://github.com/Lixkote/Startify/blob/main/tempfix.png)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baed28f2-12fb-49bf-9f2b-7741c41b7943)


Supported operating systems and configurations:
- All Windows 11 builds (stock xaml taskbar)
- All Windows 11 builds (ExplorerPatcher Windows 10 taskbar, and the reimplemented one, ep_taskbar)

Unsupported, but might "work":
- All Windows 11 builds (with StartAllBack) (Start button glitches)
- Windows 10 > 1903 (Works ok, you need to download and install Segoe Fluent Icons)
